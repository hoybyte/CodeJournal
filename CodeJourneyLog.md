### Day 4: June 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished chapter 7 in Learn Powershell in a month of lunches. I completed the exercises at the end of the chapter. I learned how to install and import modules from the Powershell Gallery. I installed the PSWindowsUpdate and PSScriptTools modules into my powershell environment. One of the exercises required me to create 10 text files and use Compare Object to determine which file names were different. Additionally, I setup my script environment last night to use the following tools - Powershell Core, Windows Terminal, Neovim, Nerd Fonts, Scoop (command line installer), PSReadLine. 

**Thoughts**: I wished I learned PSReadLine earlier in my career as it would have remembered my powershell history. Additionally, I believe that I have fallen into the rabbit hole of customizing my shell instead of performing code snippets. I am really enjoying the powershell book. Once I complete the challenge of reading a chapter a day. I will see about reading Learn Powershell Scripting in a Month of Lunches or Practical Automation with Powershell. Additionally, I may start the Powershell Cookbook 4th Edition which covers Powershell Core. 

### Day 5: June 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress** Finished reading chapter 8 in Learn Powershell in a Month of Lunches. Completed the exercises without looking at the answer section. Worked with CSS and HTML for a upcoming work project.

**Thoughts**: I am throughly enjoying the Powershell book as it is impacting my work life currently. The ability to retrieve information automatically without using a GUI and piping it to a file format in which I can give to other IT individuals and management. I am still dreading learning the website management that is required for updating our work website.
